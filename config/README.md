# CONFIG

This folder contains files for the DIG-770 Jira Ticket, aimed at improving the configurability of the GraphQL-interface service, in preparation for its integration with the CanDIGv2 stack. This folder will not exist once the integration is complete, but rather is an intermediary to house configuration files like `.env`, `docker-compose.yaml` and others during this process.

For said reason, all of the elements that need to be reviewed for this ticket are in this folder. Artifacts of previous configurations, like the Dockerfile in the root directory will be removed during the integration process.
